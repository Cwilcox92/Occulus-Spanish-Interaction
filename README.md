# Occulus-Spanish-Interaction
This was a project I put together for a collogues dissertation. The dissertation focused on the anxiety of speaking another language to someone face to face, the VR application was used to see if they felt more comfortable speaking to an avatar. 

I had less than a month to complete the project. 

The model was created using a reference picture and Ready Player Me Avatar. Unity Facecapture was used for capturing the facial movements.
*There is no code because the individual who recorded voice lines asked that the voice not be published. See the video link for an example of project*
