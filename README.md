# Occulus-Spanish-Interaction
This was a project I put together for a collogues dissertation. The dissertation focused on the anxiety of speaking another language to someone face to face, the VR application was used to see if they felt more comfortable speaking to an avatar. 

*There is no code because the individual who recorded voice lines asked that the voice not be published. See the video link for an example of project*
